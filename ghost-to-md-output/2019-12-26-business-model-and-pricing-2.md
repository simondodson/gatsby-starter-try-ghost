Marketing automation is about using software to automate marketing tasks, including emails, SMM, user support, ad campaigns, lead management, CRM, analytics, data flows and much more. It includes a set of tools, integrations, and approaches which help to personalize the experience for users and save time. In this section, we will more focus on tools as they help to build that magic automation.

- A 5-chapters overview from Salesforce: [What Is Marketing Automation?](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/what-is-marketing-automation/)
- [Segment](https://segment.com/) will help you integrate tools for analytics (ex. Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Kissmetrics) and marketing (ex. Mailchimp, Salesforce) via one place, one single API. It's like a ‚Äúhub‚Äù through which all data flows. These 2 videos explains [What is Segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkk2f9GwyNg) and [how it can help you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWawMS4nw-4&amp;t=308s). Segment also has a nice [Getting Started guide](https://segment.com/docs/guides/#getting%20started%20with%20segment) on their own site, while [this Medium](https://medium.com/saas-user-onboarding-resources/how-to-hack-your-analytics-with-segment-io-500acfc32254) post shares experience of a startup who implemented it.
