User research gives you an answer for whom is your product. Analysing potential users & customers will help to:

- understand users' needs, pains, motivations and decision-making process;
- outline product roadmap, key features, UI design and UX scenarios for interacting with your product;
- define the right marketing message (positioning) and choose marketing channels to spread this message;
- make your marketing & communication strategy.

I hope that I have convinced you that user research is very important. After learning these materials you should be able to make user research, create basic Persona and validate it on real people:

- Empathy Mapping is one more technique, which widely used in UX for user research. This [Practical Guide to Empathy Maps](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-practical-guide-to-empathy-maps-creating-a-10-minute-persona/) will give you a good overview of this approach.

You need to reach your potential users and validate your Persona & hypothesis. You can get real users insight through surveys, interviews, online & offline meetings, chats, Skype calls, checking existing analytics (Google Analytics, social media data), analyzing competitors' customers, ethical googling your users' emails & names and researching them on social media:

- Simple [blueprint](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide) for conducting a thorough buyer's journey study. It's a bit old article, but it has a nice plan for making user research interviews (study) with current or potential users.
- [Asking the right questions during user research, interviews and testing](https://uxdesign.cc/asking-the-right-questions-on-user-research-interviews-and-testing-427261742a67) will be in use when you actually start talking to potential user (ðŸ˜¤ you must do this).

ðŸ‘† User research is an initial part of customer discovery process. You should not only research your potential users but also test if what you want to build is needed on the market (itâ€™s called Product Market Fit). If you are not familiar with Lean Startup approach, I advise you to check these resources. It's more startup-oriented, but still relevant for newbie product makers:
