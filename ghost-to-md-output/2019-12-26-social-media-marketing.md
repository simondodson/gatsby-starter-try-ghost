Let's start with the basics, which can be used for any social media platform:

- [How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy From Scratch](https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-plan) by Kevan Lee, Buffer Marketing Director. It's a comprehensive long-read about basic of making your SMM strategy.
- Case-study from Hubstaff: [The Improved Social Media Content Strategy That Boosted Visits by 230%](http://blog.hubstaff.com/updating-hubstaff-social-media-content-strategy/).
- Guide on Copywriting for social media: [10 Ways to Write Damn Good Copy](http://www.copyblogger.com/good-copywriting/).
- [The Psychology of Social Sharing: How to Shape Your Content According to What People Want to Share](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/psychology-social-sharing-shape-content-according-people-want-share/) via Canva.

üìå Useful SMM toolbox:

- When you have multiple Social Media accounts, use dashboards & tools for managing them in one place. My favorite ones are [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) and [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) (both have free options). These tools have built-in analytics. So you can pick simple metrics that are meaningful and can be analyzed.
- [Pablo](https://pablo.buffer.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for fast creating of nice-looking images (both free).
- [Nuzzel](http://nuzzel.com/) can show you the top content being shared among all your followers on Twitter and Facebook. You can use that content for sharing or as an example. It's free tool.
- [Google Analytics Campaign URL builder](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) for making UTM codes and here is a guide on [Using UTM Parameters to Track Social Media Success](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/) from Hootsuite.

### üê¶ Twitter

I love Twitter as a tool for personal use. Moreover, Twitter has a huge variety of opportunities to promote your product ‚Äî personal account, company account, Direct Message Marketing, Chats, Adds. Twitter can be used for sharing your articles, connecting with influencers or looking for competitors' customers. As you see, it's a powerful platform for many marketing activities, depending on your goals.

Your personal account can drive traffic to your product and content. While growing your Twitter followers, you increase the media reach you might get. But don't forget, that Twitter is made for people. To be successful there, you need to communicate with your audience just as you would do offline. If your target audience like your tweets and your personality, there‚Äôs a higher chance they will trust you and click on your links:

- [How to Get Higher Tweet Engagement? We Analyzed 23,858 Tweets](https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/get-higher-tweet-engagement-analysis-23858-tweets/) by Karola Karlson. It's a long read about what, when and how to tweet. Although the main focus is on marketing industry, the key insights will be useful for tech as well.
- [8 Tactics for Increasing Your Twitter Reach](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/8-tactics-increasing-your-twitter-reach) by Patrick Whatman.
- [Get More (High Quality) Twitter Followers by Stalking Influencers](https://searchwilderness.com/get-followers-on-twitter/) by Paul Shapiro.
- [5 ways to increase your Tweet engagements with emojis](https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/5-ways-to-increase-your-tweet-engagements-with-emojis.html) from Twitter team.
- Taking part in Twitter chats is a great way to attract new followers and actively participate in relevant conversations with people from your industry.

There is nothing wrong with automating your Twitter activities. You can schedule posts, automatically send messages and set up rules for auto-engagement with users. However, using automation only ü§ñ will hurt your SMM strategy. So mix it with a real-time tweeting and being active & helpful with the community:

- [I Automated My Tweets for 30 Days and This is What Happened](https://inbound.org/blog/i-automated-my-tweets-for-30-days-and-this-is-what-happened) by Tami Brehse. Tami scheduled 60 tweets with her blog posts for one month. Her overall site traffic showed how people actually engage with automated tweets.
- [Twitter Deep Dive: How to Use Social Media to 10x Your Website Traffic (video)](https://moz.com/blog/twitter-deep-dive-10x-your-website-traffic-whiteboard-friday) by Tara Reed. Tara shared a cool guide on building Twitter strategy and automating your engagement workflow. Clever automation is awesome üëå.
- [How to automate Twitter content curation with RSS blog feeds](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2017/02/27/how-to-automate-twitter-to-get-attention-and-grow-your-followers/). Jeff Bullas uses Dlvr.it for automation, this tool has a good free plan. Be aware, that simply spamming content to your social networks will not work out.
- [The Pros & Cons of Twitter Automation](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/pros-cons-twitter-automation/164078/) by Michael Georgiou. Check possible downsides to know how to avoid them.
- [Is ‚Äúfake‚Äù Twitter following working?](https://aggregateblog.com/automated-twitter-following-tools/) by Karola Karlson. New accounts suffer from a lack of followers. Follow-Unfollow tools seem like an obvious solution to give you the "first followers". But in most cases, it will be bots or inactive users.

Direct Message Marketing is about sending personal, mass or automated DMs to your followers. These articles will show you how to use this tool in a right way:

- [7 Twitter Direct Message tactics absolutely anyone can use](https://audiense.com/7-twitter-direct-message-dm-tactics-anyone-social-media-marketing-communications-manager-can-use/) by Paz Segura.
- [Why Twitter Auto DMs are Evil (and what you should do instead)](http://www.blogclarity.com/why-twitter-auto-dms-are-evil-and-what-you-should-do-instead/) by Melissa Culberson. Melissa proves, that if you send impersonal auto-DM with some spam, that will only annoy your users.
- [Case study when auto-DMs actually were working](http://niknitro.com/auto-dm-not-auto-dm/) by Nik Nitro. Welcome auto-DMs should be used only when it provides tangible value to a new follower. Nik shows his example.
- [Be aware of Twitter tweet & DM limit](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364).

One more option to consider is Twitter Adds. My experience with Twitter adds was not so positive... especially when I set up the first campaign. So be ready to face poor UX, mysterious errors and bad customer support. Anyway, these guides will help you out:

- [Guide to Twitter Ads: How To Launch an Ad Campaign](https://median-ads.com/en/guides-en/guide-to-twitter-ads-how-to-launch-an-ad-campaign)

üìå And these tools help you maximize your Twitter presence, from timing to sharing to the analysis:

- [Scoutzen](https://www.scoutzen.com/) allows you to download Twitter followers from your public or private lists. Pretty useful!

### üëΩ LinkedIn

I want to tell you a secret: HR is not the only people who use LinkedIn. With this platform you can build business partnerships, network online, make direct sales and search for investors. LinkedIn is a perfect place for B2B companies and üëî business professionals. It's also useful for the self-branding. For the promotional purpose, LinkedIn has Personal Pages, Company Pages, Groups, and Ads.

Your LinkedIn profile can be a complete sales and marketing tool. It should communicate the value of your product and your expertise to potential partners. These guides and tips will help you out:

LinkedIn can help you get more eyes on your content, and receive a feedback from other folks. Contributing to a discussion will make both your profile and your Company Page more visible. If you listen to Rand Fishkin video on [Comment Marketing](https://moz.com/blog/comment-marketing-how-to-earn-benefits-from-community-participation-whiteboard-friday) you know how to establish yourself & your company as thought leaders:

When you have published your post, tweet it with ‚Äútip @LinkedInEditors‚Äù message. It will maximize your chances to be featured on LinkedIn Pulse Channels.

üï¥Ô∏èUse LinkedIn for direct sales and getting partners. You can write people via invitation note, direct message, InMail or Group message. You should have clear objectives and know exactly who you want to connect with. Business outreach is common and popular among LinkedIn members, but it should be done in a structural way:

- [11 Signs That You've Mastered LinkedIn](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/282360). Tony Messer gives a general overview of using LinkedIn with a sales purpose.

I heavily use LinkedIn. As you remember, we run [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/?utm_source=Github&amp;utm_campaign=Collection-Marketing-For-Engineers&amp;utm_medium=Free-Collection) ‚Äî a tool for iOS & macOS engineers. A lot of our users spend time on LinkedIn, participate in iOS groups or post articles there. I often post cool stuff in those groups, engage with people via direct messages or share my writings. Unfortunately, I do get spam or some random requests from job seekers\recruiters. But in general, LinkedIn works for me.

üìå Useful tools:

- If you need to grow your LinkedIn connection base, use this [script](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P2Exz5ctRRdvwOaXkFZFTmGcnvv9L5UbBmfPzqKWI8/edit#gid=0). It will automatically add targeted people from the "People You May Know" section. You only need to choose the keywords.
- [Dux-Soup](https://www.dux-soup.com/#see) is another good tool to automatically add LinkedIn connections + send invitations. Free account is not really useful. Paid version really worth 15$ a month. It has auto-inviting with personalised messages, auto-messages to 1st degree connections, downloading your tag-lists with links to profiles.
- [LinkedIn X-Ray Search tool using Google](https://www.lisearcher.com/). With a free account, you only get 100 search results. To get around this limitation you can use X-Ray Searching.

### ‚ùîQuora

Quora is a question-and-answer site, where you can get traffic by helping the community:
