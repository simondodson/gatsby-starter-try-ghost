Lifecycle emails can help you to accomplish almost any marketing goal: onboard new users, increase sales, grow users engagement, bring back inactive one or build a long-lasting relationship. It's also known as drip marketing or automated email campaigns. To make it simple: it's a set of emails that will be sent out automatically based on schedule, triggers, or user actions. There are four key components for such email campaigns: the right user, goal-oriented topic, good timing and contextual message.

ðŸ’» Let's start with onboarding. The goal of it is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. Onboarding process can be done through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls. We will focus on onboarding via emails:
