Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submitting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! üèÜ The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get a lot of honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b). Join the PH community and feel how it works, before actually starting you launch activities.

üò± Successful PH launch takes a lot of preparation, promotion during the launch (24h++) and follow-up work. These guides will help you:
